Get Started

npm install
bower install

I used mamp pro to create a local host, you can also do iis, or execute through node!

Compiler: Prepros  it's a simple less,scss, and sass compiler. Ideally grunt or gulp would be integrated into this application(i tried!)

Objectives:
Initialize a git repository on Github
Mock up an application interface that allows users to manage their favorite learning resources
Interface should include mocked up examples of:
adding a new website resource (form)
adding a new book resource (form)
adding a new podcast resource (form)
button components to add, edit, remove items
Get as creative as you'd like with the functionality (feel free to include more than one view that shows different application states, or add some JavaScript if you’d like to change application state)
Create a base layout using a CSS pre-processor
Add an animation example using CSS
Add an example of responsive layout

Goals/wishlist for the project:

The goal for me was to be able to dive into angular, bower,grunt, node, and create a concept and design for the app. Also I did not want to use plugins to achieve this, I wanted to write custom code to show that I could meet the requirements without plugins. I also wanted to integrate with sound cloud, a book api, and rss feeds for fitness.

The reason why the theme is fitness is because I have recently started working out at orange theory fitness. Ever since I moved to Colorado almost 4 years ago my diet has went from fast food and sugar to clean food and yes of course the green smoothie. I gave up sweet tea and orange chicken to be a healthier person. I am on my 9th week of orange theory and I have never felt better! It’s a slow process but being healthy will be worth it in the end.

Process

I researched Gloo and found their main colors and brought that into the application. I originally wanted to have multiple views with a resting json object to bring in all of the data from storage and post that in multiple views. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to achieve this. I knew I needed to get a move on the project and wrap it up so i tried to keep it simple and then broke the structure at 2 am. I ended up having to restart from scratch and really really simplify the application to get this test done, I decided I can always clean it up and add to it at a later time.

Each mocked up section is treated as a section for the single page app and the whole thing is responsive!


Please Enjoy!
I am looking forward to hearing feedback!
